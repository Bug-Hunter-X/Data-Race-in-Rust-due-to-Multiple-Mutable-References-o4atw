This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: data races caused by multiple mutable references to the same data.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits this issue, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a possible solution by using mechanisms that avoid data races.  Understanding and avoiding data races is crucial for writing safe and correct concurrent Rust code.
